# Project description:
Agentic AI Workflows with Conditional Nodes and Routing Logic in LangGraph

# Tools:
•	jupyter notebook
•	Langchain                                                                         
•	LangGraph
•	gpt-4o-mini
•	Agentic AI fundamentals

# Workflow objectives:
•	Make an agentic AI pipeline.
•	Use decision nodes in LangGraph
•	Apply branching logic in LangGraph.
•	Use LLM 

# Key components:
•	Context related routing with LangGraph
•	LLM nodes with task targeting 
•	LLM Processing Pipeline
•	Reusable platform design
•	Visualization for LangGraph routing flow
•	Reusable platform layout

# Agent performance summary:
This project underscores an reusable agentic AI system with a combination of decision nodes, LLM, and branching logic.  Milestones include:
•	Query routing founded on user input.
•	Targeted sector addressing anime, DC comics, games and marvel.
•	LLM produced coherent answers   
•	Extensible Agent Framework
